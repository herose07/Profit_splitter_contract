# Profit_splitter_contract

This project involves building smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

The profit splitter contracts will do the following:
  * Pay Associate-level employees quickly and easily.
  * Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.
  * Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.
